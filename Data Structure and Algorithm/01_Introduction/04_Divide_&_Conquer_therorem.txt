Divide and Conquer Theorem
    A divide and conquer algorithm is a strategy of solving a large problem by
        * breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems
        * solving the sub-problems, and
        * combining them to get the desired output.
    To use the divide and conquer algorithm, recursion is used. 

Tip: 
    Use the divide and conquer approach when the same subproblem is not solved multiple times. Use the dynamic approach when the result of a subproblem is to be used multiple times in the future.

Divide and Conquer Applications:
    * Binary search
    * Mearge sort
    * Quick sort
