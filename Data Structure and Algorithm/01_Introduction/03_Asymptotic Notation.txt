Asymptotic Notation :
    * Big O-notation 
    * Theta notation
    * Omega notation

    Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm when the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value.

    For example: In bubble sort, when the input array is already sorted, the time taken by the algorithm is linear i.e. the best case.
    But, when the input array is in reverse condition, the algorithm takes the maximum time (quadratic) to sort the elements i.e. the worst case.
    When the input array is neither sorted nor in reverse order, then it takes average time. These durations are denoted using asymptotic notations.

    * Big O-notation:
        * it gives the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.
        * f(n) = O(g(n))
        * it is widely used to analyze an algorithm
    
    * Omega notation:
        *  it provides the best case complexity of an algorithm.
        * f(n) = omega(g(n))
        * the minimum time required by the algorithm.

    * Theta notation:
        * it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm.
        * f(n) = theta(g(n))
        * If a function f(n) lies anywhere in between c1g(n) and c2g(n)  for all n â‰¥ n0, then f(n) is said to be asymptotically tight bound.
