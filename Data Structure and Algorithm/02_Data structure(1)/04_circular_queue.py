    * A circular queue is the extended version of a regular queue where the last element is connected to the first element. Thus forming a circle-like structure.

    * In a normal queue, after a bit of insertion and deletion, there will be non-usable empty space.
    * indexes 0 and 1 can only be used after resetting the queue (deletion of all elements).This reduces the actual size of the queue.
